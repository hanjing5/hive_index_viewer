Due to the Async model of node we want to be able to run several queries at once, for this to work we create a new connection for each query to run in and then close it when the query is completed. There is currently no support for connection pooling as most users run a small number of long running hive queries but pooling should be possible if and when it's needed.\n\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThrift module has been cloned from https://github.com/wadey/node-thrift/commit/25c0eb4eb85aa63cfb49a8e8c815bd57e2b8043a\n\nnodejs bindinga are generated from hive 0.6.1 CDH3B4",
